# Final Project for C++

For the C++ course you will have to build a nice app/game on your own.

**DEADLINE: 4th of January.** Doesn't mean you should build the app in december. Final touches can be made then.

All code should be placed inside this git project and be accompanied by a README and Makefile.

## CLI ChatApp

Build a chat application that works from the terminal. Allow people to create/join channels in which they can chat. Also allow private messages.

For communication, several options exists: TCP Sockets, MQTT, ..

## General

- The whole app/game should be object oriented. No global stuff. Main should also be clean.
- Code should be your own. You can research techniques and such but no code copy pasting. If teacher finds out (and he/she does 9 out of 10 times), the other guy/girl gets the grades and not you.
- Decent GIT history so teacher can track your progress through time. This means committing often and committing small. This is also part of proving your code is your own.
- Provide a decent README explaining your project, how it is structured, what fancy techniques you used, how someone can build your app and how to run it. Also add a couple of screenshots in your README off how your app looks.
- A makefile so the user only needs to use `make` to build your app.
- Check if your application runs on other systems (Windows vs Linux). If not, no problem, but make sure to document this inside your README.
